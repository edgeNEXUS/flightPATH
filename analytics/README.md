## These Rules

These rules provide content insertion of useful and common analytics code snippets (often JavaScript) usually required on every page of a site.

### Installation

If you'd rather not use Git then click on the rule you want to install (above), then click **Raw** and then **Save [Page] As...** and download the text file to a suitable location. 

Then, in the jetNEXUS GUI, browse to `Advanced > Configuration > Browse`, choose the rule you downloaded and click on **Upload Config or jetPACK**.

Rules can be modified to suit your needs under: `Library > flightPATH`.

To assign rules to Virtual Services go to: `Services > IP Services > Virtual Services > flightPATH`.
